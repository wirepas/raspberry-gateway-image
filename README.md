# Raspberry gateway image

The purpose of this repository is to create automatically a ready to use RaspberryPi image containing all the needed files to setup a Wirepas gateway.
This image allows to easily configure the Wirepas sink and transport services as well as sink parameters from files located in the FAT32 boot partition of the RaspberryPi which can be easily edited.
Other Raspeberry Pi parameters like Network settings, Wi-Fi and others setting are not modified by the image.

# How it works?

## create_image.sh
The entry point for this repository is the [create_image.sh](create_image.sh) script.
This script downloads an official Raspberry pi image and mounts it as a loopback to modify some files and add new ones.

The script is run followingly
```
./create_image.sh my_gateway my_gateway_folder lite
```
where

* $1: name of final image
* $2: output folder
* $3: lite or desktop


Here is the list of modifications done:

1. Enabling ssh by default
An empty file ssh is copied under /boot/ to enable ssh connection.
Default login/password are not modified and must be modified in case this gateway is deployed on a public network.

2. Modification to use /dev/ttyAMA0
Raspberry Pi has a real uart that is by default used for the on board bluetooth chip.
/boot/cmdline.txt and /boot/config.txt are modified to release it. NOTE: On board bluetotth is not functional anymore

3. Add multiple systemd job files to create a Wirepas gateway
They are described in next chapter

4. Install a mosquitto broker in order to ease a simple testing (this broker can be used to see the gateway traffic).
NOTE: This is only for testing purpose as MQTT broker is usually located in a server or cloud with a multigateway system.

## Systemd services

### wirepasFirstboot.service
This service  is in charge of calling the [firstboot.sh](firstboot.sh) script to install the Wirepas gateway and its dependencies.
It requires a connection to internet in order to work.
It will be started in loop every 10 sec until it succeed (ie, a connection to internet is available).
When it has successfully run (it takes 3 to 5 minutes), following systemd job are started and the Raspberry Pi is rebooted.
It will never run again.

The script [firstboot.sh](firstboot.sh) could be used on any debian based linux to install a Wirepas gateway.

NOTE: Local optional MQTT broker is installed in this script as well

### wirepasSink1.service
This service manages the Wirepas Sink Service and is configured with the keys WM_GW_SINK_* from [gateway.env](templates/gateway.env) file.
This file must be copied under /boot/wirepas/ for the service to find it (after the image has been flashed to the SD-Card).

### wirepasTransport.service
This service manages the Wirepas Transport Service and is configured with the same [gateway.env](templates/gateway.env) file.
This file must be copied under /boot/wirepas/ for the service to find it (after the image has been flashed to the SD-Card).

To use the local MQTT broker installed previously, the following config can be done:
```ini
WM_SERVICES_MQTT_HOSTNAME=localhost
WM_SERVICES_MQTT_PORT=1883
WM_SERVICES_MQTT_USERNAME=
WM_SERVICES_MQTT_PASSWORD=
WM_SERVICES_MQTT_FORCE_UNSECURE=true
```

### wirepasConfigurator.service
This service can configure the sink parameters with values contained in [sink.env](templates/sink.env) file.
This service will run only if the file sink.env is copied in /boot/wirepas/ (after the image has been flashed to the SD-Card).

After a successful execution, the file is renamed sink.success in the SD-Card and wonâ€™t be executed again. You can edit this file later on and rename it as sink.env.
At next reboot the gateway will configure the sink again with these new parameters.


# How are released image built?

Images under [release tab](https://github.com/wirepas/raspberry-gateway-image/releases) are automatically build with github actions repository is tagged.
